## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The college affordability calculator idea came behind the increasing $1.6 trillion student loan debt caused by the ambiguity of the Federal Student Aid application & the rising cost of tuition. 
The calculator provides transparency in the cost of college to better prepare families financially. The application allows students to determine how much college they can buy. The calculator subtracts college tuition from the Federal Pell Grant based on full or part time enrollment. Users will find the calculator useful in budgeting and making their final college decision. 

### Features
1. FAFSA EFC input: Uses will be able to enter FAFSA EFC to determine Pell Grant amount to pay for college tuition.
2. Select Enrollment: Users will be able to choose full or part time college enrollment status.
3. Select School: Users will be able to choose from Florida Atlantic University and Broward College.
3. View balance: Users will be able to view balance from Pell Grant and tuition calculation. 
	If the balance is greater than zero, amount represents refund owed to user. 
	If balance is less than zero, output represents balanced owed from student.
